1.Description
-------------
MNIST data set is used to calculate 1-nearest neighbours error rate and perform n-fold cross validation and report its error


2. Code Usage
--------------
Python 3 file :mnist1NNdemo.py 
Execution : Execute the code ./mnist1NNdemo.py  in terminal or it can be executed through Visual studio code IDE

3.Output:
---------
The output will give the error rate based on change in training data and also gives n-fold cross validation error for different values of n
Plots : The  first plot compares the error rate with respect to change in training samples
        The second plot shows the change in error rate with n-fold cross validation.


Output is stored in ./MEHTA_662520990/MEHTA_662520990-mnist.pdf and code is placed under ./MEHTA_662520990/code/ directory
